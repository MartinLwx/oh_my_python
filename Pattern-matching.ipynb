    "To recap, the syntax rules of the `switch` statement:\n",
    "1. `expression` should be the `int` or `char` type. `constant` should be the `int` or `char` constant\n",
    "2. The execution process of the `switch` statement: Calculate the value of `expression`, and compare this value with each `constant` **from top to bottom**. If they are equal, the statements **inside the specific `case` and all the `case` after the matched `case`** will be executed, unless it finds a `break` statement. This feature is called *Fall through*, and we can use this feature to stack multiple `case` statements together to represent a logical \"or\" relationship\n",
    "3. The `default` branch will be executed when all the previous `case` branches fail to match\n",
    "\n",
    "Python does not provide a `switch` statement, but we can use `if...elif..elif..else` to achieve the same effect, *for example, suppose we want to perform different operations depending on the length of the `list`, We can write this*:"
